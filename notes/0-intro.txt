- A chrome extension is a small softaware program that customizes the browsing experience
- It consists of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a manifest.json


HOW CHROME EXTENSIONS WORK
============================
- A Chrome extension consists of several components that work together:

    1. Manifest File (manifest.json) – The blueprint of the extension, defining its name, permissions, and main files.

    2. Popup (Optional) – A small UI that appears when clicking the extension’s icon.

    3. Content Scripts – JavaScript that runs on web pages to modify content dynamically.

    4. Background Scripts – Code that runs in the background, handling events and automation.

    5. Options Page (Optional) – A settings page where users can configure the extension.
